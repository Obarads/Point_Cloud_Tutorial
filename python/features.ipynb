    "点群を用いたタスクを解くために、点群では特徴を抽出する必要があります。この特徴の背景については[Rusu, 2010]のSection 4冒頭で説明されています。以下は、その文章を丸々引用したものとなります。\n",

    "> In their native representation, points as defined in the concept of 3D mapping systems are simply represented using their Cartesian coordinates $x, y, z$, with respect to a given origin. Assuming that the origin of the coordinate system does not change over time, there could be two points $p_1$ and $p_2$ , acquired at $t_1$ and $t_2$ , having the same coordinates. Comparing these points however is an ill-posed problem, because even though they are equal with respect to some distance measure (e.g. Euclidean metric), they could be sampled on completely different surfaces, and thus represent totally different information when taken together with the other surrounding points in their vicinity. That is because there are no guarantees that the world has not changed between $t_1$ and $t_2$. Some acquisition devices might provide extra information for a sampled point, such as an intensity or surface remission value, or even a color, however that does not solve the problem completely and the comparison remains ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Applications which need to compare points for various reasons require better characteristics and metrics to be able to distinguish between geometric surfaces. The concept of a 3D point as a singular entity with Cartesian coordinates therefore disappears, and a new concept, that of local descriptor takes its place. The literature is abundant of different naming schemes describing the same conceptualization, such as shape descriptors or geometric features but for the remaining of this document they will be referred to as point feature representations.\n",
