# Dataset
## Introduction
3D data can be obtained from public 3D datasets. However, the format and structure of the data in a 3D dataset often differ depending on the dataset. This section demonstrate examples to get data from datasets with different specifications.  

## Dataset download type:
There are three download type in used the tutorial:
1. All data: download all data of a dataset.
2. Split data: download data per samples.
3. Request: to use the dataset, you need to acquire usage permission from the publisher.

## Dataset list
This section introduce the following dataset of 3D representation.
