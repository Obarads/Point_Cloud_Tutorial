# Dataset
## Introduction
3D data can be obtained from public 3D datasets. However, the format and structure of the data in a 3D dataset often differ depending on the dataset. This section demonstrate examples to get data from datasets with different specifications.  

## Dataset list
This tutorial introduce the following dataset of 3D representation. 

Table columns mean:
- `download type` : There are two download type in used the tutorial,
  1. All data: download all data of a dataset.
  2. Split data: download data per samples.
- `Request`: If this column is `o`, you need to acquire usage permission from the publisher.
