# Point cloud tutorial
This repository contains tutorial code and supplementary note for point cloud processing. In order to understand algorithm of point cloud processing, most codes are implemented with [Numpy](https://numpy.org/).

## Repository structure
```bash
┌─ data             # 3D files for examples
├─ .devcontainer    # Dockerfile for this tutorial
└─ python           # tutrial codes
    ├─ tutlibs      # package for tutorial codes
    └─ *.ipynb      # tutorial codes
```

## How to use
### 1. Enviroment
You can execute most tutorial codes on [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)(CPU resource). If you have GPU resource, can execute all tutorial codes. For more environment of CPU and GPU, Please refer to [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md).
